Maya playing in beach with her dad.
Maya couldn’t wait to explore the beach with her bucket and spade.
Maya carefully builds a tall sandcastle, shaping towers with joy.
She climbed over the rocks, discovering tide pools full of sea creatures.
A shiny blue stone sparkled in the forest stream, calling to her.
The stone glowed softly in her hands, as if holding a secret.
A soft voice whispered “Help… help…” from the waterfall nearby.
Maya looked around the meadow, wondering where the voice could be coming from.
To her surprise, the fishes smiled and spoke to her in the clear pond.
One little fish cried out that their friend was trapped and needed help.
Maya bravely pulled the tangled net from the roots of the mangrove trees.
The fishes cheered and invited Maya to follow them for a special surprise.
Deep inside the cave, a pearl shone like the moon waiting just for her.
Holding the pearl close, Maya smiled as the sunset painted the mountains golden.
Maya reunites with her father.
